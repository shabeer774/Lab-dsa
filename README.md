Courier Management System (Java)
A console-based Courier Management System developed in Java, demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, along with sorting and searching algorithms.
This project allows users to manage domestic and international parcels, calculate estimated delivery time, and search parcels efficiently.

Features:

Add Domestic and International parcels
Manage Sender and Receiver information
Automatic delivery time estimation
Dynamic array resizing for parcels
Sort parcels by Parcel ID
Binary Search to find parcels by ID
Console-based interactive menu

OOP Concepts Used:
Encapsulation – Private data with getters and setters
Inheritance – DomesticParcel and InternationalParcel inherit from Parcel
Abstraction – Abstract Parcel class with abstract method
Polymorphism – Overridden calculateDeliveryTime() method
Composition – Parcel contains Person objects
